Hi! This is the repository for my history project involving climate change action/activism. 
It includes four pages detailing the problems and potential solutions to Climate Change.

This was outside the scope of the history project's requirements but it seemed a fun way to get into
the webdev environment. I self taught myself HTML and CSS (with a little bit of AJAX and JavaScript)
in the two month duration of the project!
